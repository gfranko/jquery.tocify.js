jquery.tocify.js - jQuery Table of Contents
-------------------------------------------

A jQuery plugin that dynamically generates a table of contents. Tocify can be optionally styled with **Twitter Bootstrap** or **jQueryUI Themeroller**, and optionally animated with jQuery show/hide effects. Tocify also optionally provides support for **smooth scrolling**, **scroll highlighting**, **scroll page extending**, and **forward and back button support**.

##Requirements
jQuery 1.7.2+

jQueryUI Widget Factory 1.8.21+

##Browser Support
IE7+, Firefox 4+, Chrome, Safari 4+, and Opera 11+

##Unit Tests
All unit tests are written using the Jasmine Framework (Work in Progress)

##Contributing
Take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add Jasmine unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).

If you plan to contribute to `Tocify` in the future, keep in mind that you should make sure your code passes the Grunt checks.  If you are on Windows (like me) remember you need to run the grunt command using `grunt.cmd`.  Also, if you have trouble getting the Jasmine Unit Tests to work with PhantomJS 1.5 (the current release), install PhantomJS 1.3.

After you have verified your code, send a pull request to the `Tocify` dev branch.  After you send a pull request, you will hear back from me shortly after I review your code.

You'll find source code in the "src" subdirectory!
